# Creating a wish tree for MozFest 2017 

Session: [Open Science Public Park](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/574)

## Overview

To help seed collaboration across the open science projects at MozFest (or still in your head!), the open science public park will feature a "wishing" tree.

[See examples](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=wishing+tree&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi338zEjrHWAhXnD8AKHbRSB8MQ_AUICygC&biw=1867&bih=916)

On this tree, project leads can post their projects, and interested contributors can add their details to a project. It will be a visual and creative focal point for open science enthusiasts to meet, work and collaborate. (I've asked for some beanbags/chairs/table from Mozilla.)

## How to contribute

**Before** MozFest, check out the plan below, and let me know if you know better/spot any flaws/would like to help! :hugs:

On **Friday October 27**, help me assemble the tree at the venue :sparkles:

**During MozFest**, come decorate the tree with blossom, leaves, or your project / contribution wishes :tada:

## The wishes

The wishes on the tree will be your open source projects that you would like to showcase and request help with (primarily in the open science domain). Potential contributors can attach their contributor cards to your project, to show how they'd like to help. By Sunday afternoon, the aim is to have the tree laden with projects and collaboration offers.

Once you've posted your project card, you are invited to type up your project card to list on Mozilla Network Pulse, and reach out to the interested contributors. We hope this will help seed further collaborations and contributions for your project.

* 150 x badge holders

### Instructions for adding a wish

1. You can **post your project**.

* Slot this card into a A5 wallet.
* Hang it on the tree with twine.

The earlier you do this, the more your project will be seen - post your project on MozFest Saturday!

2. You can **pledge your contribution**.

* On the small card template provided (business card size), tell us who you are, your skills, interests, and what you'd like to contribute to / learn via the project in question.
* Slot this card into a badge holder.
* Attach it to the relevant project card using treasury tags.

## Related event

On MozFest Sunday, eLife will be hosting a lunchtime event for open science project leads and interested contrbutors to gather. We invite you to present your project and call for contributors in a short (2-minute) talk on our open science soapbox. It's an open 'mic' (without a mic though!) so you can register your interest early (method TBC) or come along on the day.
